"You can divide the array in 3 equal parts and use three variables top1,top2,top3 to keep track of the index at the top, then everytime
an element is added it is copied in the index that corresponds to top and the stack where its being added and then the top value is updated
(same when deleting). If the array overflows a bigger one is created and all elements are copied into it."
